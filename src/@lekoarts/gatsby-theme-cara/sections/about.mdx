## About

 
Everyone would tell me, "You should become a software developer!" 

The guidance that isn't accompanied by a "why." Although I've always had a passion for social impact, and aspired to be a social entrepreneur who saves lives, creates jobs, and empowers girls to reach their full potential through education, I realized that it is important to have a vision. Still, it is equally important to have an effective tool - programming. 


I became a software developer to create amazing applications and websites that will positively impact the world. 
I unpack complex systems by approaching the problem-solving process and a strong sense of ownership and drive. This includes the work with other engineers to ask questions, define approaches, and execute solutions.
